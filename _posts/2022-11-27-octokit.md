I've holding off on merging [Starkast/wikimum#305](https://github.com/Starkast/wikimum/pull/305) that bumps [octokit.rb](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) from 4.20.0 to 4.22.0. I had a feeling that it would be good add some more test coverage before merging it.

Today I [added a test](https://github.com/Starkast/wikimum/commit/975c31c224186e2a2c62da0e8b3754e3009da513) covering the use of `Octokit` when taking care of another bug I had seen. After that, #305 had failing tests:

```ruby
  1) Error:
AppTest#test_authorize_callback:
WebMock::NetConnectNotAllowedError: Real HTTP connections are disabled. Unregistered request: GET https://api.github.com/user with headers {'Accept'=>'application/vnd.github.v3+json', 'Accept-Encoding'=>'gzip;q=1.0,deflate;q=0.6,identity;q=0.3', 'Content-Type'=>'application/json', 'User-Agent'=>'Octokit Ruby Gem 4.22.0'}
```

[WebMock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) reported unregistered requests, which was strange since I did have stubs for all the requests being made – I could see the tests pass in the default branch (that was on octokit 4.20.0)!

Looking closer I could see that the unregistered request webmock complained about did not have the `Authorization` header. That was also a strange thing. I began reading [the diff between 4.20.0 and 4.22.0](https://my.diffend.io/gems/octokit/4.20.0/4.22.0). Not many changes, but sure enough, the diff touched on authorisation and even refered to a comment in [a pull request](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/pull/1359):

From there I found [octokit/octokit.rb#1392](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/issues/1392) and I understood what was going on: [octokit/octokit.rb#1359](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/pull/1359) had introduced changes that were not compatible with Faraday 0.17.x but it wasn't reflected in the gemspec. [Ocktokit v4.23.0](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/releases/tag/v4.23.0) changed the Faraday dependency requirement (when work was done to [allow both Faraday 1.x and 2.x](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/pull/1411)).

Thus Dependabot created a pull request for bumping Ocktokit to v4.22.0 but never past that as I was locked to Faraday < 1 by [`sentry-raven`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/tree/v2.9.0).
